A simple yet effective programming language. Easy tconsoleo learn and powerful.

This file  keeps my progress in learning to code in python.

Goals are to make small programs that my co.workers can use to register data or make records over systemusers or other.

To do list:
1. Hello World #Completed print "My first string!"
2. Input from user in console "raw_input("Give me a number: ") # completed
3. Varibles "string" decimal float 12.00002 #completed
4. Open and save files. # Append, writeline, write, trancate(delete)
5. Define a function my_firstFunction(arg1, arg2): # Completed 
6. Modules from sys import argv #Completed
7. Aritmetic operators # completed but with a need to learn more about modulus and what to use it for.
8. Logic If, Do-while, for, ifnot, do-until
9. Create files
10. Connect to  sql-server
11. Make a datareader
12. Create, Delete, insert and update records
13. Search and autofill textboxes in programs from tables
14. Secure that no one else modifys current records or posts at the same time.
15. GUI that are nice and do not look home made...
16. Server side language and user scripts
17. APIs important for accessing large data
18. Exporting data from table to a csv file for easy import to excel
19.
